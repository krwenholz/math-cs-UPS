================================================================

Hosting the testing and development of Puget Sound's Math/CS department site.

# Usage
Below are some instructions for making changes to the website through WordPress
and/or the actual PHP code.

## Logging in
You can log into the WordPress administration interface through virtually any
web browser by going to the 
[wp-admin page](http://www.mathcs.pugetsound.edu/wp-admin).  If you need 
credentials to log in, ask Carl Toews, Giot Concepcion or Kyle Wenholz.

## Adding Faculty
After logging in, use the menu bar to the left and select "Faculty".  You'll
be taken to a page with "Faculty" displayed at the top and a list of the 
current members below.  Click the link "Add New Faculty Member" next to the 
title at the top or on your left menu bar.  Fill in all of the appropriate
information asked for in "Faculty Member Info".  Avoid using the "Custom 
Fields" section, since this is intended for advanced users.  Once you have
filled in the appropriate information, click the "Publish" button inside of
the "Publish" box to the right hand side.

## Adding a Seminar
After logging in, use the menu bar to the left and select "Seminar".  You'll
be taken to a page with "Seminar" displayed at the top and a list of the 
current seminars below.  Click the link "Add New Seminar" next to the 
title at the top or on your left menu bar.  Fill in all of the appropriate
information asked for in "Enter Title Here" and "Seminar Info".  You should 
put abstracts in the large text box in the center of the page. Avoid using 
the "Custom Fields" section, since this is intended for advanced users.  
Once you have filled in the appropriate information, click the "Publish" 
button inside of the "Publish" box to the right hand side.
